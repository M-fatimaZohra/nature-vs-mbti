# Nature Through Minds Constitution

## Purpose

This project is an educational, static website designed to demonstrate Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit Plus.

It explores:

1. The beauty of nature
2. How different MBTI personality types perceive nature

The project serves both as:
- A learning resource about nature and psychology
- A practical example of structured specification writing

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-first, code-second
Every feature starts with a specification; code is implemented only after spec approval; Clear separation between requirements and implementation ensures quality

### II. Human-centered storytelling
Focus on emotional connection and user experience; Content must resonate with diverse personality types; User empathy drives design decisions

### III. Psychological diversity and emotional awareness
Embrace different perspectives and personality types; Content must be accessible and meaningful to various MBTI types; Psychological sensitivity in presentation and interaction

### IV. Simplicity, clarity, and beauty
Minimalist design approach; Clean, readable codebase; Beautiful presentation of nature content; Unnecessary complexity must be justified

### V. Educational value and accessibility
Content must be educational and informative; Website must be accessible to all users; Learning outcomes clearly defined and measurable

### VI. Static and performant

Static site architecture for speed and reliability; Performance optimized for all devices; Fast loading times prioritized

## Technology Constraints

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript only
- No backend, no frameworks
- Fully static and accessible
- No external dependencies
- Responsive design required

## Non-Goals

- No authentication
- No databases
- No advanced animations or heavy graphics
- No backend services
- No real-time features
- No user-generated content

## Success Criteria

- Clear separation of specification phases
- Easy navigation and readable content
- Emotional connection with users
- Clean, understandable codebase
- Educational value demonstrated
- Accessible to diverse audiences

## Guiding Philosophy

> "Nature is the same, yet every mind sees it differently."

## Governance

This constitution governs all development decisions; Amendments require documentation and team approval; All PRs must verify compliance with these principles; Code reviews check for adherence to constraints
