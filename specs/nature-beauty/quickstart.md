# Quickstart: Nature and Its Beauty

## Getting Started

1. Create the main HTML file:
   ```bash
   # Create the main page
   touch index.html
   ```

2. Set up the directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir styles scripts assets
   mkdir assets/images assets/icons
   ```

3. Create the main files:
   ```bash
   touch styles/main.css styles/responsive.css
   touch scripts/smooth-scroll.js
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Start with semantic HTML structure in `index.html`
2. Add content for the four nature sections (Forest, Ocean, Mountain, Sky)
3. Apply styling in `styles/main.css` using calming colors
4. Make responsive with `styles/responsive.css`
5. Add smooth scrolling behavior in `scripts/smooth-scroll.js`

## Key Files to Edit

- `index.html` - Main page structure
- `styles/main.css` - Color palette and typography
- `styles/responsive.css` - Mobile/desktop layouts
- `scripts/smooth-scroll.js` - Scrolling behavior

## Testing

- Open `index.html` in a browser
- Verify the page is calming and uncluttered
- Test on different screen sizes
- Ensure smooth scrolling works
- Check that content is readable and inspires calmness
